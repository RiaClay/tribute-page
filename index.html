        <p id="intro">
            Over the past the past five decades, humankind has seen massive progression socially and economically. Much of this progression is due
            to the significant technological advancements we have seen. When we think of technolog, we often think of things like the internet, smartphones,
            and virtual reality. However, technology has been contributing to our lives way before the era of the digital technology. In fact, since the stone age,
            technology has been used to make our lives more efficient and much more comfortable. With each new technology age, our lives have become significantly 
            more improved than our ancestors.

            It's hard to imagine what our lives would be like without technology. Technology has truly played a major part in the improvement of our lives. To honor this
            fact, here are some ways that technology has improved our lives since the stone age.

                    The stone age is the longest technological era of the humans. Tools developed during this time were used to help our ancestors food gathering and shelter.
                    Sure, compared to today, these technologies may not appear to be so great. But could you imagine having to catch food with no tools whatsoever?

                <p id="stone-age-tools">
                    The tools developed from this age were made up of stone and usually composed of sharp edges and points such as stone axes. 
                    Other tools included Oldowan tools, which were used for settlement purposes. During the later parts of the stone age, technology became
                    more advanced with the introduction of tools such as musical instruments and sewing needles for clothing. Other notable tools are: hammers, chisels, and
                    adzes.

                    Once live became more static and less nomadic, the need for technology focused on domestication and land cultivation was needed. While the length of this time period
                    can be debated, it is generally accepted that technology advancement during this area were for agricultural purposes, regardless of the material used to make them. Without the 
                    technologies from this era, we wouldn't have the knowledge of agriculture that we have today. It was during the later part of this era, that economies started to evolve into buying
                    and selling of goods on a larger scale.

                    Tools such as the plow and wheel were developed during this time. These tools were widely used to produce crops and raise livestock. Because of this, 
                    humans became less nomadic and were able to start building communities. In different regions, innovation in agriculture led to develops in irrigation as well as
                    more sophisticated tools. Some of the tools that made farming and land settlement easier were the rake, the scythe, the harrow, the pitchfork, and the flail.
